# Evaluate trigger status during 2023 season

The trigger is evaluated at two points in time:

- Trigger I: In March, if the trigger is met for risk  of below average
precipitation in the June, July, August period5,
funds  are  released  for  the  commencement  of  activities  by  all
selected  sectors,  including  food  security  and
livelihoods, nutrition, protection, as well as water, hygiene, and sanitation.
- Trigger II: In July, if the trigger is met for risk of below average
precipitation in the August, September, and October
period, funds are released for the implementation of activities by the
food security and livelihoods sector.

The trigger makes use of IRI's seasonal tercile precipitation forecast and
is defined as:

1. 40% or more probability of below average rainfall AND
2. The probability of below average rainfall should be 5 percentage points
higher than that of above average rainfall.

Finally,  activation  is  also  contingent  on  at  least  10%  of  the  zone
(Boucle  de  Mouhoun,  Centre  Nord,  Sahel,  and  Nord)
meeting these criteria. This criterion aims to capture through geographical
spread a more severe e shock,  in line with the
humanitarian objectives of the pilot. Overall, this framework aims to
target 1 in 4-year type of event

gdf_adm1 = codab.load(admin_level=1)
geobb = GeoBoundingBox.from_shape(gdf_adm1)
gdf_aoi = gdf_adm1[gdf_adm1.ADM1_FR.isin(constants.adm_sel)]
```


```python
trig_year = 2023
```

## Inspect forecasts

We load the iri data indicating the dominant tercile.
The negative values indicate forecasted below average rainfall,
and the positive values above average. We use rounded bins (e.g. -40 to 40).
The IRI website bins are slightly different,
where values between -37.5 and 37.5 are assigned to the normal tercile.

We plot the forecast raster data for the periods and leadtimes of interest.
The red areas are the admin1's we are focussing on.
These figures are the same as
[the figure on the IRI Maproom](https://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/maproom/Global/Forecasts/NMME_Seasonal_Forecasts/Precipitation_ELR.html)
, except for the bin boundaries.

```


```python

```python
# F indicates the publication month, and L the leadtime.
# A leadtime of 1 means a forecast published in May is forecasting JJA

Note that for the
[presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DSFSVfV4JCnB43vQP155omYS2cf082nHmk3O38WBYWg/edit?usp=sharing)
the legend from IRI's website was added instead of this one as it more clearly
shows what the numbers mean. Be aware that
[IRI's website legend](https://iri.columbia.edu/our-expertise/climate/forecasts/seasonal-climate-forecasts/)
shows normal values to be grey whereas they are in our graphics
(and actually also in IRI's) white.
